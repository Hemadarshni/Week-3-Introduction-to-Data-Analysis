# Week-3-Introduction-to-Data-Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on basic data analysis using Python and the Pandas library. A real-world sales dataset is analyzed to understand sales performance. The program calculates total sales, identifies the best-selling product, and generates a simple analysis report.

This project introduces working with CSV files, cleaning data, calculating statistics, and presenting insights in a clear format.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

Understand what data analysis is and why it is important

Learn how to use Pandas for data analysis

Load and explore data from a CSV file

Handle missing or incorrect data

Calculate meaningful sales metrics

Generate a clean and readable report

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Library: Pandas

File Format: CSV

Editor: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 GitHub Repository Structure

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation Instructions
Step 1: Install Python

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Step 2: Install Pandas

Run the following command in terminal or command prompt:

pip install pandas
Step 3: Run the Program

Open the project folder

Run the analysis script:

python sales_analysis.ipynb

## 🧾 Code Structure Explanation

sales_analysis.py contains the Python code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and reporting

sales_data.csv contains the sales dataset

analysis_report.md contains the summary of findings

requirements.txt lists required libraries

## 🧠 Data Analysis Steps Explained

1️⃣ Loading the Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Pandas read_csv() function.

2️⃣ Exploring the Data

The first few rows are displayed

The dataset shape (rows and columns) is checked

Column names and data types are reviewed

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Missing values are checked

Duplicate rows are removed

The dataset is cleaned before analysis

4️⃣ Sales Analysis Metrics

The following metrics are calculated:

Total Sales Revenue (sum of Total_Sales)

Best-Selling Product (highest quantity sold)

Average Sales Value

Highest and Lowest Sales

The month with the highest sales and the Total sales

## 🛠️ How Technical Requirements Are Met

Use Pandas to load, clean, and analyze data

Handle missing values, checked, and cleaned the dataset using Pandas methods

Calculate metrics like Total sales, best-selling product, and average sales

A clean, formatted report included results written clearly in the report file

Comments added for each analysis step explained in code

## 📊 Sample Analysis Output
Total Sales Revenue: 12,365,048.00

Best-Selling Product: Laptop

Average Sales Value: 123,650.48

Highest Sales Value: 373,932.00

Lowest Sales Value: 6,540.00

Month with highest sales: March

Total Sales: 4,485,006.00

## 📘 Key Findings
